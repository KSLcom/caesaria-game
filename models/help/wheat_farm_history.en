 text  : "Egypt and North Africa were the breadbasket of the Roman empire, and the Emperor was directly responsible for keeping the grain ships sailing to satisfy the city's 400,000-ton annual demand. The state became responsible for providing its lower classes with a subsistence diet, and cuts or increases in 'the Dole,' upon which three quarters of Rome's population depended, affected public contentment and civic stability. To encourage shippers to risk shipwrecks and piracy and keep the corn coming in, the Emperor exempted grain merchants from local taxes. Grains were grown to a lesser extent throughout the Roman Empire, mainly to meet local demand. For centuries, grinding and baking were done in each household, although specialized millers and bakeries eventually appeared. Corn was the main staple, but barley and wheat also formed important parts of the Roman diet."
