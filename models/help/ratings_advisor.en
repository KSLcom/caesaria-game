 text  : "Your Ratings Advisor displays your current ratings in Culture, Prosperity, Peace and Favor, along with any requirements for promotion to the next assignment. When you build a Senate, the flags in front of the building rise and fall in concert with your ratings, giving you a rough idea of how you're faring without having to consult this panel. Click on these numbers for brief advice on how to improve them. See the @Ratings& entry for detailed information on what each means."
