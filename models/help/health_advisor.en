 text  : "This advisor reports the number of working bath-houses, barbers, clinics and hospitals in your city, as well as how many people they serve and how good their overall coverage is. If you see a deficit in one or more areas, use the @Health Overlay& to find the neighborhoods that will benefit the most from new health facilities. Citizens who aren't visited by doctors are at a higher risk of disease, especially if they aren't eating a healthy diet.\n The @Health& entry will help you understand this panel's function."
