 text  : "Caesar regularly evaluates your success as a governor, and rates you in Culture, Prosperity, Peace and Favor, each of which is discussed below. The Emperor often decides whether and when to promote you from one assignment to the next based upon these scores. To find out how you're doing, and to see what Caesar expects of you, check the @Ratings Advisor&.\n The culture rating for a city is a measure of how cultured it is. It takes into account the quality of education, plays at theaters and religious services offered by a city.\n Your Culture rating depends on how many educational, religious and recreational opportunities you establish relative to your overall population size. As your populace grows, provide more schools, academies, libraries, large and small temples, oracles and theaters. If population grows faster than you erect these structures, your Culture rating falls; if you establish cultural institutions faster than your citizenry increases, your Culture rating will rise.\n Click on the Culture number on your Ratings Advisor's report for a specific recommendation on improving your city's culture. Theaters are the only entertainment venue that contributes to Culture.\bPROSPERITY&\n Your Prosperity rating is a measure of the overall city's wealth, including the poor, not just how wealthy your rich citizens are. A large proportion of poor citizens (measured by the type of dwelling they occupy) reduces the city's Prosperity rating. High unemployment also lowers Prosperity. Paying high wages relative to Rome, and earning a profit for the city overall while keeping unemployment low is the simple recipe for raising prosperity - simple to understand, if hard sometimes to achieve. Higher quality housing pays more taxes, which helps your city turn a profit.\n Your Prosperity rating improves as long as your treasury takes in more money than it spends, unless high unemployment or low average housing levels in your city hold this growth back. Ending a year with empty coffers hurts your Prosperity rating, even though Caesar might extend credit or even grant you emergency funds. Money spent on construction doesn't count against Prosperity, since it goes toward improving the city.\bPEACE& \n The Peace rating measures how relaxed people feel about their safety in your city. Destruction of property disrupts that feeling of well-being. Regardless of whether the destruction is caused by invaders or by riots, Peace falls when violence strikes. Only prolonged periods of time without destruction will restore people's peace of mind, and raise the city's Peace rating.\bFAVOR& \n Each province you govern requires particular tasks or accomplishments. The Emperor watches your progress towards meeting those goals. Rapid progress pleases him; slow progress doesn't. He sometimes makes special requests of you, giving you a chance to substantially improve your standing in his eyes - or to incur his wrath should you ignore him or fail to deliver.\n Maintaining Caesar's Favor should be a high priority. Your Favor rating starts with Caesar mildly pleased with you (I suppose he must be to trust you with the governorship of a new province). If you do nothing to attract the Emperor's attention, Favor falls steadily as the years go by - Caesar tends to forget about you and your province. To raise Favor, honor Caesar's requests, make fast progress toward the goals defined for your assignment, and send him gifts. If you ignore his requests, run out of money or remain stuck in one assignment forever, you lose Favor.\n If your Favor rating falls to 10 percent, Caesar sends an army to remove you from office and reclaim your province for Rome. That army camps outside your province for one year. If you manage to raise your Favor rating back to at least 35 percent in that time, Caesar recalls the army to Rome. If you fail to do that, Caesar orders his army to take your province. You lose the game if that happens.\n Because virtually every aspect of Caesar III affects your ratings, please use the @Table of Contents& to find Help on related topics."
