  "##lindu—å_preview_mission##" : "Our borders to the Far East, the South and the West are secure. The various Germanic tribes threaten the near eastern border, as they have always done, and Rome's legions are committed to that frontier. I have no troops left for the far North, or generals to command them.\n You will secure Britannia, once and for all. Build a medium city far to the north, in the province called Lindum. Here, your military prowess will be as important as your governing skills. Your assignment is to build a wall that will keep the Celts and their brethren out of Britannia.\n Security is your main concern in Lindum, but I also challenge you to achieve high ratings to prove yourself worthy of the next, final promotion. If you can do it, I shall turn the Empire itself over to you. I have wanted to retire for some years now, but, lacking an heir, I need to find a worthy successor. Prove yourself this one last time, and the ultimate prize is yours!"
