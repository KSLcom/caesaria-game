  "##miletus_preview_mission##" : "Our recent expansion in the east must continue, now that the Greeks have reluctantly joined our Empire. You are to establish Miletus as a great new city. Miletus is key to bringing Asia under Roman rule, as well as being the gateway to many other beckoning lands, from Aegyptus to Syria.\n Create a city on the Lycian coast. I expect you to achieve levels of Culture and Prosperity beyond what you've done so far. The peoples of the East must clearly see the benefits of Roman rule.\n One small obstacle is the lack of farmland in this province. However, Miletus affords Roman citizens a new way to make a living. At Miletus, you will pioneer fishing.\n Romans have always been hesitant mariners. Although we do set sail to conquer overseas enemies and spread our Empire to far shores, we Romans prefer to keep our feet dry. No Roman city has ever fished for its food on a large scale.\n PYou will change that. Miletus has abundant fishing grounds. You can spot them by the sea birds circling overhead.\n Build a shipyard to construct fishing boats.\n Fishing boats do not work out of the shipyard. To provide crews and to process their cargoes, build wharves. One wharf can serve only one fishing boat, so you must build a new wharf for every new fishing vessel that your shipyard builds.\n Wharf workers will take fish to the granary, where it can be distributed just like any other food.\n Oh, by the way: I said that this is a peaceful province, but 'peaceful' is a relative term when you get this far away from Rome. You should be ready for trouble. Pay attention to any reports of enemy activity, and be ready to defend your city. Walls and towers, backed up by a legion or two, ought to be quite sufficient."
