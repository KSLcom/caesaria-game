  "##sarmizegetusa_preview_mission##" : "The Roman Empire now includes nearly every habitable land in the world - except for the dark forests of Germania and Dacia. That is where you're going next.\n Build a medium city in the enemy's heartland. You will meet stiff resistance from local tribes, the most noteworthy being the Goths. Build the appropriate defenses, and defeat them, time after time, until they either learn to leave you alone, or extinguish themselves trying to harm your city.\n In the meantime, we are taking the fight to them. They have crossed our border and terrorized our citizens for the last time.\n The province itself is large, and reasonably rich in resources. Native villages already occupy some of the best land, but you know how to deal with them. Your legions will have plenty of chances to exercise their sword arms, but there is nothing that should prevent your success at Sarmizegetusa."
