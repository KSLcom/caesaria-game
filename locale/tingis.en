  "##tingis_preview_mission##" : "Our expansion West has ended at the edge of the world. I want a major Roman city built at Tingis, to anchor our western border and to guard the approach to Hispania.\n Various forces throughout Africa and Mauretania resent our presence, and will object strongly when they realize that you are blocking their passage north. Expect steady raids by nomadic tribes, and possibly more coordinated attacks by the wild Numidians. \n Tingis has no iron mines. You must trade for weapons. I have commanded Carthago Nova to sell you all that they can spare. Open a route to them as soon as you are ready to establish your legions - which will be early in your city's history, if you are wise.\n Because I expect your attention to be adequately occupied in building a large city and fending off frequent attacks, your ratings requirements are modest."
