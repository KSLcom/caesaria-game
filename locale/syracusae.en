  "##syracusae_4_overview##" : "Syracusae is an important site for a new colony. A glance at the map will show you why. If we are to expand the Empire much beyond the shores of Italia, we must control these waters.\n Others have reached the same conclusion. We have been unable to reliably establish a permanent city of any size at Syaracusae. The challenge before you â€“ and a serious challenge it is! - is to found a new city, and defend it against the enemies of Rome. Expect trouble from the Graeci.\n To make matters more -- interesting, shall we say?... Syracusae has precious little farmland. Although the climate is ideal for olives, you will probably have to commit much of your farming to wheat, just to feed your people. Perhaps you can alleviate food shortages with imports, I don't know. I have not studied all the small details of this assignment; that is why I hire governors. I do hope  that you can grow at least some olives. The Empire has a voracious appetite for oil. \n Knowing the difficulties in this assignment, I have set only modest goals for you to achieve. I trust you can overcome the obstacles and succeed at least as well as you did last time."
