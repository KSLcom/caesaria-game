  "##carthago_preview_mission##" : "Caesar is presently returning from a trip to Carthago, where he met with that province's governor. A messenger from the Emperor arrived just this morning. Caesar commands me, his proconsul for Roma, to present you with the following instructions:\n The Carthaginians were not gracious after Hannibal's defeat ended the Punic War. As much as it pained us, we had to raze their city and bring its residents to Rome - in chains. I ordered one of my other governors to build a new city near the former site of Carthago, to demonstrate that it is truly a Roman possession, now and forever.\n Despite the totality of our victory, some remnants of the Carthaginian army still operate in the area. Their presence encourages the natives there to resist Rome's rule, and the province is severely unsettled. The Carthaginians remain fierce fighters, and they have not been idle while we built our new city.\n The governor to whom I entrusted this assignment was not capable of meeting the challenge. With a heavy heart, I have removed him from power. I now call upon you to come to Carthago and set matters right.\n Take over this city, in which we have already invested so much money and labor. The governor was a capable builder and you have a good colony to start with. Your main challenge is to defend it from a seemingly endless series of desperate raids. The ratings that I defined for Carthago, although only moderate, eluded its former governor so persistently that he fell entirely out of my Favor. Those ratings are reasonable and they remain important to me. I have not relaxed them.\n Carthago is a large province, but its fertility is low. Native tribes control what little farmland exists. These local barbarians are quite wild and uncontrolled. Your first task should be to subdue them, or win their cooperation.\n To avoid antagonizing them any further, do not build anything on the land that they consider to be theirs. (Use the 'Risks' Overlay to see the area they claim as their own).\n Some governors report satisfactory results from building mission posts on the natives' land. Missionaries can teach them some rudiments of civilized conduct.\n Eventually, they might even trade with you. Roman goods are a powerful lure for peaceful conduct. If you see carts moving between the native village and your city's warehouses, the natives have accepted your presence and you can safely build on their land. They will give you no further problems after they begin trading."
