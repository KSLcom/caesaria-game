  "##caesarea_preview_mission##" : "How I wish that all of my governors were as successful as you are!\n Are you surprised that I would say that? We do not advertise Rome's failures, preferring to handle them quietly. Sadly, some governors abuse the trust that I have placed in them. I take this personally.\n Your colleague in Caesarea proved to be little more than a common thief. The fool pocketed all of the denarii that his account books showed being spent on prefectures and prefect salaries. His fraud caused exactly the problems you would expect of a city without prefects. He was hardly as clever as he thought himself!\n This former governor now rots in the Mammertine Prison. It amuses me to tie his fate to that of Caesarea.\n You, my most promising governor, will take over Caesarea. Restore the city to its former glory, and achieve the ratings I've defined for you. If you can undo the harm that its previous governor caused, I will show him mercy, and merely exile him from the Empire. If you cannot save Caesarea, he will die as slowly and painfully as did his former city. Needless to say, I will be sorely disappointed in you if you stumble. I take my governors' failures personally, too.\n Oh, besides the problems stemming from mismanagement, our old foes the Numidians are still active in the region. Don't neglect the city's defense."
