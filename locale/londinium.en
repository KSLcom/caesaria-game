  "##londinium_preview_mission##" : "You will enjoy this assignment. It is the most constructive that I've awarded in quite some time.\n With Gaul finally integrated into the Empire, we are free to expand our northern boundary to its logical extreme: Britannia. Yes, Romans have gone there in the past, but never before with the intention of establishing a permanent presence.\n PI grant you a huge, fertile province in which to build a major port city, to be called Londinium. In keeping with the richness of this new province, I expect you to achieve very high ratings.\n The barbarians who live on Britannia thought that their island would always keep them safe from the Roman Empire. They are likely to be very upset when they see the magnificence of Londinium. Be sure you prepare for armed resistance. Most of the tribes there are laughably weak, but the Celts might give you some trouble."
