  "##lutetia_preview_mission##" : "As part of my plan to consolidate the western provinces, I command that a new capital be built deep in the heart of wildest Gaul.\n Caesar Augustus once predicted that the Gauls would become model Roman citizens. It is time that the great Augustus' vision was realized. In the midst of this savage land, you are to build Lutetia into a major Roman city, unsurpassed in Culture, Prosperity and Peace. I grant you a huge, rich province in which to accomplish this.\n The Peace requirement might cause you some difficulty. Far from verging on Roman citizenship, many Gallic tribes remain mired in the most primitive barbarism. They will not peacefully watch Rome civilize their ancestral lands. You have a large city to raise to high standards, and a hostile land in which to do it."
