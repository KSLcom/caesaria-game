  "##damascus_preview_mission##" : "The Empire's western provinces are bustling since my consolidation program succeeded so well. Now I want to apply the same policies to our eastern borders.\n Damascus is a good place to start. Build a medium city there, and absorb the natives already living in the province. Nameless nomadic raiders have long plagued the province, and Egyptians have given us trouble over the years, too, despite Alexandria's inclusion in the Empire.\n The land there is not especially good for building or for farming. I am confident that you won't let that stop you. Your success will go far toward calming the East."
