  "##mediolanum_preview_mission##" : "I now require a major Roman city on the Empire's northern border. Create a city of no fewer then 7000 souls, within sight of the Alps. Furthermore, I expect you to achieve higher levels of Prosperity and Culture than you have done so far, although your goals are still only moderately high.\n Ordinarily, I would expect more of you from a province as large as Mediolanum. But the rugged terrain will provide you with a new challenge, and this time of rampant warfare is hard on all of my governors.\n The great Carthaginian general Hannibal is on the march, and Rome is locked in the greatest struggle in her long history. When this so-called Punic War finally ends, either Rome or Carthage will rule the Mediterranean for all time. Of course Rome shall prevail, but I've yet to find the general who can crush this Hannibal.\n With the Alps guarding your province, you probably have less to fear from Hannibal than do most other Roman governors. No army could cross such a barrier! Nonetheless, Rome's enemies are bolder than ever. Prepare strong defenses, just in case. The Carthaginians are formidable warriors."
