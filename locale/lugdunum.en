  "##lugdunum_preview_mission##" : "Caesar is traveling this month on a matter which need not concern you. I, the Emperor's proconsul for Roma, shall explain your next assignment in his stead.\n Caesar decreed that the Empire shall now grow northward, beyond our traditional Alpine boundary. Create a medium-sized city in Gaul, and meet the more ambitious ratings that he has defined for you.\n You will not encounter any armed resistance, and won't need to build defensive works. However, a small tribe of natives already lives in your new province. These barbarians will not trouble you if you stay away from their village. (Use the 'Risks' Overlay to see the area they claim as their own).\n At some point, build a mission post on the natives' land. Your missionaries will teach them some rudiments of civilized conduct.\n Eventually they might even trade with you. If you see carts moving between the native village and your city's warehouses, the natives have accepted your presence and you can safely build on their land.\n If you handle them properly, the natives will be no more than a minor nuisance to your city's growth. The rugged terrain is probably your true challenge. Some Roman philosophers believe that the very wildness of the northern lands explains why the people there have remained so primitive through the ages. The local Gauls will be awed when Lugdunum achieves the levels of Culture, Prosperity and Peace that Caesar expects."
