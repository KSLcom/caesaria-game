  "##massilia_preview_title##" : "Final Glory"
  "##massilia_preview_mission##" : "Against my better judgment, I shall tell you a secret.\n All the world hails me as Emperor and god, but I still wear the flesh of a man. I am getting on in years, and supreme power weighs heavier each day. I wish to be one of the few Emperors in Rome's long history to enter a peaceful and voluntary retirement. The lack of a natural-born heir is the only barrier to my plan.\n Every patrician in Rome would quickly offer himself as my successor, but the more avidly they want it, the less suited they are for such power. You alone have shown the ability and the devotion to govern in my place.\n I have one last assignment for you - the ultimate test of your governing skills. You will build a glorious city in Massilia, a province with little farmland, meager resources and some armed resistance. Local Gauls are again fighting Roman rule. Some barbarians never learn!\n You must achieve very high ratings to show yourself worthy of the ultimate promotion. Build an extremely prosperous city that rivals Rome in Culture, and earn high Favor with me. Use all your talent to make Massilia your crowning achievement, and I will overlook the differences that you and I have had in the past. I am weary. Do not disappoint me now, with the final prize in your sight!"
