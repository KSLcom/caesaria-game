  "##valentia_preview_mission##" : "For many generations, we have recognized Toletum as the capital of Hispania. As part of my consolidation of the western provinces, I command that a new capital be built on the coast, where it may be more tightly integrated with the rest of the Empire. Toletum has long struck me as too independent.\n To leave no question in the citizens' minds about which city is Hispania's true capital, build Valentia into a major city, unsurpassed in Culture, Prosperity and Peace. I grant you a huge, rich province in which to accomplish this.\n The Peace requirement might give you some minor difficulties. Rome subjugated the Etruscans in Italia ages ago, but some seem to have emigrated to Hispania. Some barbarians calling themselves Etruscans have been active in the area. If you take the usual defensive precautions, they will be no more than a distraction."
